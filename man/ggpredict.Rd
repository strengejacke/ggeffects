\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{ggeffects}, as returned by \code{predict_response()},
\code{ggpredict()}, \code{ggeffect()}, \code{ggaverage()} or \code{ggemmeans()}.}

\item{row.names}{\code{NULL} or a character vector giving the row
    names for the data frame.  Missing values are not allowed.}

\item{optional}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, setting row names and
    converting column names (to syntactic names: see
    \code{\link[base]{make.names}}) is optional.  Note that all of \R's
    \pkg{base} package \code{as.data.frame()} methods use
    \code{optional} only for column names treatment, basically with the
    meaning of \code{\link[base]{data.frame}(*, check.names = !optional)}.
    See also the \code{make.names} argument of the \code{matrix} method.}

\item{...}{Arguments are passed down to \code{ggpredict()} (further down to \code{predict()})
or \code{ggemmeans()} (and thereby to \code{emmeans::emmeans()}), If \code{type = "simulate"},
\code{...} may also be used to set the number of simulation, e.g. \code{nsim = 500}.
When calling \code{ggeffect()}, further arguments passed down to \code{effects::Effect()}.}

\item{stringsAsFactors}{logical: should the character vector be converted
    to a factor?}

\item{terms_to_colnames}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, standardized column names (like
\code{"x"}, \code{"group"} or \code{"facet"}) are replaced by the variable names of the focal
predictors specified in \code{terms}.}

\item{model}{A model object, or a list of model objects.}

\item{terms}{Names of those terms from \code{model}, for which predictions should
be displayed (so called \emph{focal terms}). Can be:
\itemize{
\item A character vector, specifying the names of the focal terms. This is the
preferred and probably most flexible way to specify focal terms, e.g.
\code{terms = "x [40:60]"}, to calculate predictions for the values 40 to 60.
\item A list, where each element is a named vector, specifying the focal terms
and their values. This is the "classical" R way to specify focal terms,
e.g. \code{list(x = 40:60)}.
\item A formula, e.g. \code{terms = ~ x + z}, which is internally converted to a
character vector. This is probably the least flexible way, as you cannot
specify representative values for the focal terms.
\item A data frame representing a "data grid" or "reference grid". Predictions
are then made for all combinations of the variables in the data frame.
}

\code{terms} at least requires one variable name. The maximum length is four terms,
where the second to fourth term indicate the groups, i.e. predictions of the first
term are grouped at meaningful values or levels of the remaining terms (see
\code{\link[=values_at]{values_at()}}). It is also possible to define specific values for focal
terms, at which adjusted predictions should be calculated (see details below).
All remaining covariates that are not specified in \code{terms} are "marginalized",
see the \code{margin} argument in \code{?predict_response}. See also argument \code{condition}
to fix non-focal terms to specific values, and argument \code{typical} for
\code{ggpredict()} or \code{ggemmeans()}.}

\item{ci_level}{Numeric, the level of the confidence intervals. Use
\code{ci_level = NA} if confidence intervals should not be calculated
(for instance, due to computation time). Typically, confidence intervals are
based on the returned standard errors for the predictions, assuming a t- or
normal distribution (based on the model and the available degrees of freedom,
i.e. roughly \verb{+/- 1.96 * SE}). See introduction of
\href{https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/ggeffects.html}{this vignette}
for more details.}

\item{type}{Character, indicating whether predictions should be conditioned
on specific model components or not, or whether population or unit-level
predictions are desired. Consequently, most options only apply for survival
models, mixed effects models and/or models with zero-inflation (and their
Bayesian counter-parts); only exception is \code{type = "simulate"}, which is
available for some other model classes as well (which respond to
\code{simulate()}).

\strong{Note 1:} For \code{brmsfit}-models with zero-inflation component, there is no
\code{type = "zero_inflated"} nor \code{type = "zi_random"}; predicted values for these
models \emph{always} condition on the zero-inflation part of the model. The same
is true for \code{MixMod}-models from \strong{GLMMadaptive} with zero-inflation
component (see 'Details').

\strong{Note 2:} If \code{margin = "empirical"}, or when calling \code{ggaverage()} respectively,
(i.e. counterfactual predictions), the \code{type} argument is handled differently.
It is set to \code{"response"} by default, but usually accepts all possible options
from the \code{type}-argument of the model's respective \code{predict()} method. E.g.,
passing a \code{glm} object would allow the options \code{"response"}, \code{"link"}, and
\code{"terms"}. For models with zero-inflation component, the below mentioned
options \code{"fixed"}, \code{"zero_inflated"} and \code{"zi_prob"} can also be used and will
be "translated" into the corresponding \code{type} option of the model's respective
\code{predict()}-method.

\strong{Note 3:} If \code{margin = "marginalmeans"}, or when calling \code{ggemmeans()}
respectively, \code{type = "random"} and \code{type = "zi_random"} are not available,
i.e. no unit-level predictions are possible.
\itemize{
\item \code{"fixed"} (or \code{"count"})

Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects or conditional
model only. For mixed models, predicted values are on the
\emph{population-level}, i.e. \code{re.form = NA} when calling \code{predict()}. For
models with zero-inflation component, this type would return the
predicted mean from the count component (without conditioning on the
zero-inflation part).
\item \code{"random"}

This only applies to mixed models, and \code{type = "random"} does not
condition on the zero-inflation component of the model. Use this for
\emph{unit-level} predictions, i.e. predicted values for each level of the
random effects groups. Add the name of the related random effect term
to the \code{terms}-argument (for more details, see \href{https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html}{this vignette}).
\item \code{"zero_inflated"} (or \code{"zi"})

Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects and the
zero-inflation component, returning the expected value of the response
(\code{mu*(1-p)}). For For mixed models with zero-inflation component (e.g.
from package \strong{glmmTMB}), this would return the expected response
\code{mu*(1-p)} on the \emph{population-level}. See 'Details'.
\item \code{"zi_random"} (or \code{"zero_inflated_random"})

This only applies to mixed models. Predicted values are conditioned on
the fixed effects and the zero-inflation component. Use this for
\emph{unit-level} predictions, i.e. predicted values for each level of the
random effects groups. Add the name of the related random effect term to
the \code{terms}-argument (for more details, see \href{https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html}{this vignette}).
\item \code{"zi_prob"}

Returns the predicted zero-inflation probability, i.e. probability of a
structural or "true" zero (see
\href{https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_comparisons_4.html}{this vignette}
for a short introduction into zero-inflation models).
\item \code{"simulate"}

Predicted values and confidence resp. prediction intervals are based on
simulations, i.e. calls to \code{simulate()}. This type of prediction takes
all model uncertainty into account. Currently supported models are
objects of class \code{lm}, \code{glm}, \code{glmmTMB}, \code{wbm}, \code{MixMod} and \code{merMod}.
Use \code{nsim} to set the number of simulated draws (see \code{...} for details).
\item \code{"survival"} and \code{"cumulative_hazard"}

Applies only to \code{coxph}-objects from the \strong{survial}-package and
calculates the survival probability or the cumulative hazard of an event.
}

When \code{margin = "empirical"} (or when calling \code{ggaverage()}), the \code{type}
argument accepts all values from the \code{type}-argument of the model's respective
\code{predict()}-method.}

\item{typical}{Character vector, naming the function to be applied to the
covariates (non-focal terms) over which the effect is "averaged". The
default is \code{"mean"}. Can be \code{"mean"}, "\code{weighted.mean}", \code{"median"}, \code{"mode"}
or \code{"zero"}, which call the corresponding R functions (except \code{"mode"},
which calls an internal function to compute the most common value); \code{"zero"}
simply returns 0. By default, if the covariate is a factor, only \code{"mode"} is
applicable; for all other values (including the default, \code{"mean"}) the
reference level is returned. For character vectors, only the mode is returned.
You can use a named vector to apply different functions to integer, numeric and
categorical covariates, e.g. \code{typical = c(numeric = "median", factor = "mode")}.
If \code{typical} is \code{"weighted.mean"}, weights from the model are used. If no
weights are available, the function falls back to \code{"mean"}. \strong{Note} that this
argument is ignored for \code{predict_response()}, because the \code{margin} argument
takes care of this.}

\item{condition}{Named character vector, which indicates covariates that
should be held constant at specific values. Unlike \code{typical}, which
applies a function to the covariates to determine the value that is used
to hold these covariates constant, \code{condition} can be used to define
exact values, for instance \code{condition = c(covariate1 = 20, covariate2 = 5)}.
See 'Examples'.}

\item{back_transform}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} (the default), predicted values for
log-, log-log, exp, sqrt and similar transformed responses will be
back-transformed to original response-scale. See
\code{\link[insight:find_transformation]{insight::find_transformation()}} for more details.}

\item{vcov}{Variance-covariance matrix used to compute uncertainty estimates
(e.g., for confidence intervals based on robust standard errors). This
argument accepts a covariance matrix, a function which returns a covariance
matrix, or a string which identifies the function to be used to compute the
covariance matrix.
\itemize{
\item A covariance matrix
\item A function which returns a covariance matrix (e.g., \code{stats::vcov()})
\item A string which indicates the kind of uncertainty estimates to return.
\itemize{
\item Heteroskedasticity-consistent: \code{"HC"}, \code{"HC0"}, \code{"HC1"}, \code{"HC2"},
\code{"HC3"}, \code{"HC4"}, \code{"HC4m"}, \code{"HC5"}. See \code{?sandwich::vcovHC}
\item Cluster-robust: \code{"vcovCR"}, \code{"CR0"}, \code{"CR1"}, \code{"CR1p"}, \code{"CR1S"},
\code{"CR2"}, \code{"CR3"}. See \code{?clubSandwich::vcovCR}.
\item Bootstrap: \code{"BS"}, \code{"xy"}, \code{"fractional"}, \code{"jackknife"}, \code{"residual"},
\code{"wild"}, \code{"mammen"}, \code{"norm"}, \code{"webb"}. See \code{?sandwich::vcovBS}
\item Other \code{sandwich} package functions: \code{"HAC"}, \code{"PC"}, \code{"CL"}, or \code{"PL"}.
}
}

If \code{NULL}, standard errors (and confidence intervals) for predictions are
based on the standard errors as returned by the \code{predict()}-function.
\strong{Note} that probably not all model objects that work with
\code{predict_response()} are also supported by the \strong{sandwich} or
\strong{clubSandwich} packages.

See details in \href{https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/practical_robustestimation.html}{this vignette}.}

\item{vcov_args}{List of arguments to be passed to the function identified by
the \code{vcov} argument. This function is typically supplied by the
\strong{sandwich} or \strong{clubSandwich} packages. Please refer to their
documentation (e.g., \code{?sandwich::vcovHAC}) to see the list of available
arguments. If no estimation type (argument \code{type}) is given, the default
type for \code{"HC"} equals the default from the \strong{sandwich} package; for type
\code{"CR"} the default is set to \code{"CR3"}. For other defaults, refer to the
documentation in the \strong{sandwich} or \strong{clubSandwich} package.}

\item{weights}{This argument is used in two different ways, depending on the
\code{margin} argument.
\itemize{
\item When \code{margin = "empirical"}, \code{weights} can either be a character vector,
naming the weigthing variable in the data, or a vector of weights (of same
length as the number of observations in the data). This variable will be
used to weight adjusted predictions.
\item When \code{margin = "marginalmeans"}, \code{weights} must be a character vector and
is passed to \code{\link[emmeans:emmeans]{emmeans::emmeans()}}, specifying weights to use in averaging
non-focal categorical predictors. See https://rvlenth.github.io/emmeans/reference/emmeans.html
for details.
}}

\item{verbose}{Toggle messages or warnings.}

\item{bias_correction}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, adjusts for bias-correction when
back-transforming the predicted values (to the response scale) for
non-Gaussian \emph{mixed models}. Back-transforming the the population-level
predictions ignores the effect of the variation around the population mean,
so the result on the original data scale is biased due to \emph{Jensen's
inequality}. That means, when \code{type = "fixed"} (the default) and population
level predictions are returned, it is recommended to set \code{bias_correction = TRUE}.
To apply bias-correction, a valid value of sigma is required, which is
extracted by default using \code{\link[insight:get_variance]{insight::get_variance_residual()}}. Optionally,
to provide own estimates of uncertainty, use the \code{sigma} argument. Note that
\code{bias_correction} currently only applies to mixed models, where there are
additive random components involved and where that bias-adjustment can be
appropriate. If \code{ggemmeans()} is called, bias-correction can also be applied
to GEE-models.}

\item{interval}{Type of interval calculation, can either be \code{"confidence"}
(default) or \code{"prediction"}. May be abbreviated. Unlike \emph{confidence
intervals}, \emph{prediction intervals} include the residual variance (sigma^2) to
account for the uncertainty of predicted values. Note that prediction
intervals are not available for all models, but only for models that work
with \code{\link[insight:get_sigma]{insight::get_sigma()}}. For Bayesian models, when \code{interval = "confidence"}, predictions are based on posterior draws of the linear
predictor \code{\link[rstantools:posterior_epred]{rstantools::posterior_epred()}}. If \code{interval = "prediction"},
\code{\link[rstantools:posterior_predict]{rstantools::posterior_predict()}} is called.}
}
\value{
A data frame (with \code{ggeffects} class attribute) with consistent data columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{"x"}: the values of the first term in \code{terms}, used as x-position in plots.
\item \code{"predicted"}: the predicted values of the response, used as y-position in plots.
\item \code{"std.error"}: the standard error of the predictions. \emph{Note that the standard
errors are always on the link-scale, and not back-transformed for non-Gaussian
models!}
\item \code{"conf.low"}: the lower bound of the confidence interval for the predicted values.
\item \code{"conf.high"}: the upper bound of the confidence interval for the predicted values.
\item \code{"group"}: the grouping level from the second term in \code{terms}, used as
grouping-aesthetics in plots.
\item \code{"facet"}: the grouping level from the third term in \code{terms}, used to indicate
facets in plots.

The estimated marginal means (or predicted values) are always on the
response scale!

For proportional odds logistic regression (see \code{?MASS::polr})
resp. cumulative link models (e.g., see \code{?ordinal::clm}),
an additional column \code{"response.level"} is returned, which indicates
the grouping of predictions based on the level of the model's response.

Note that for convenience reasons, the columns for the intervals
are always named \code{"conf.low"} and \code{"conf.high"}, even though
for Bayesian models credible or highest posterior density intervals
are returned.

There is an \code{\link[=as.data.frame]{as.data.frame()}} method for objects of class \code{ggeffects},
which has an \code{terms_to_colnames} argument, to use the term names as column
names instead of the standardized names \code{"x"} etc.
}
}
\description{
After fitting a model, it is useful generate model-based estimates (expected
values, or \emph{adjusted predictions}) of the response variable for different
combinations of predictor values. Such estimates can be used to make
inferences about relationships between variables.

The \strong{ggeffects} package computes marginal means and adjusted predicted
values for the response, at the margin of specific values or levels from
certain model terms. The package is built around three core functions:
\code{predict_response()} (understanding results), \code{test_predictions()} (testing
results for statistically significant differences) and \code{plot()} (communicate
results).

By default, adjusted predictions or marginal means are by returned on the
\emph{response} scale, which is the easiest and most intuitive scale to interpret
the results. There are other options for specific models as well, e.g. with
zero-inflation component (see documentation of the \code{type}-argument). The
result is returned as consistent data frame, which is nicely printed by
default. \code{plot()} can be used to easily create figures.

The main function to calculate marginal means and adjusted predictions is
\code{predict_response()}. In previous versions of \strong{ggeffects}, the functions
\code{ggpredict()}, \code{ggemmeans()}, \code{ggeffect()} and \code{ggaverage()} were used to
calculate marginal means and adjusted predictions. These functions are still
available, but \code{predict_response()} as a "wrapper" around these functions is
the preferred way to do this now.
