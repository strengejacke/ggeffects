\title{Calculate representative values of a vector}
\usage{
values_at(x, values = "meansd")

representative_values(x, values = "meansd")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{values}{Character vector, naming a pattern for which representative values
should be calculcated.
\itemize{
\item \verb{"minmax": }(default) minimum and maximum values (lower and upper bounds)
of the moderator are used to plot the interaction between independent
variable and moderator.
\item \code{"meansd"}: uses the mean value of the moderator as well as one standard
deviation below and above mean value to plot the effect of the moderator
on the independent variable.
\item \code{"zeromax"}: is similar to the \code{"minmax"} option, however, \code{0} is always
used as minimum value for the moderator. This may be useful for predictors
that don't have an empirical zero-value, but absence of moderation should
be simulated by using 0 as minimum.
\item \verb{"fivenum": }calculates and uses the Tukey's five number summary (minimum,
lower-hinge, median, upper-hinge, maximum) of the moderator value.
\item \code{"quart"}: calculates and uses the quartiles (lower, median and upper) of
the moderator value, \emph{including} minimum and maximum value.
\item \code{"quart2"}: calculates and uses the quartiles (lower, median and upper) of
the moderator value, \emph{excluding} minimum and maximum value.
\item \code{"terciles"}: calculates and uses the terciles (lower and upper third) of
the moderator value, \emph{including} minimum and maximum value.
\item \code{"terciles2"}: calculates and uses the terciles (lower and upper third)
of the moderator value, \emph{excluding} minimum and maximum value.
\item \code{"all"}: uses all values of the moderator variable. Note that this option
only applies to \code{type = "eff"}, for numeric moderator values.
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length two or three, representing the required
values from \code{x}, like minimum/maximum value or mean and +/- 1 SD. If
\code{x} is missing, a function, pre-programmed with \code{n} and
\code{length} is returned. See examples.
}
\description{
This function calculates representative values of a vector,
like minimum/maximum values or lower, median and upper quartile etc.,
which can be used for numeric vectors to plot adjusted predictions at these
representative values.
