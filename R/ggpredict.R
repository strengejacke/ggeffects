#' @title Marginal effects, adjusted predictions and estimated marginal means from regression models
#' @name ggpredict
#'
#' @description
#'   The **ggeffects** package computes estimated marginal means (predicted values)
#'   for the response, at the margin of specific values or levels from certain 
#'   model terms, i.e. it generates predictions by a model by holding the
#'   non-focal variables constant and varying the focal variable(s).
#'
#'   `ggpredict()` uses [`predict()`] for generating predictions, while
#'   `ggeffect()` computes marginal effects by internally calling
#'   [`effects::Effect()`] and `ggemmeans()` uses [`emmeans::emmeans()`].
#'   `ggaverage()` uses [`marginaleffects::avg_predictions()`]. The result is
#'   returned as consistent data frame.
#'
#' @param model A fitted model object, or a list of model objects. Any model
#'   that supports common methods like `predict()`, `family()`
#'   or `model.frame()` should work. For `ggeffect()`, any model
#'   that is supported by **effects** should work, and for
#'   `ggemmeans()`, all models supported by **emmeans** should work.
#' @param terms Names of those terms from `model`, for which predictions should
#'   be displayed (so called _focal terms_). Can be:
#'   - A character vector, specifying the names of the focal terms. This is the
#'     preferred and probably most flexible way to specify focal terms, e.g.
#'     `terms = "x [40:60]"`, to calculate predictions for the values 40 to 60.
#'   - A list, where each element is a named vector, specifying the focal terms
#'     and their values. This is the "classical" R way to specify focal terms,
#'     e.g. `list(x = 40:60)`.
#'   - A formula, e.g. `terms = ~ x + z`, which is internally converted to a
#'     character vector. This is probably the least flexible way, as you cannot
#'     specify representative values for the focal terms.
#'   - A data frame representig a "data grid" or "reference grid". Predictions
#'     are then made for all combinations of the variables in the data frame.
#'
#'   At least one term is required to calculate effects for certain terms,
#'   maximum length is four terms, where the second to fourth term indicate the
#'   groups, i.e. predictions of first term are grouped at meaningful values or
#'   levels of the remaining terms (see [`values_at()`]). If `terms` is missing
#'   or `NULL`, adjusted predictions for each model term are calculated (i.e.
#'   each model term is used as single focal term). It is also possible to define
#'   specific values for focal terms, at which adjusted predictions should be
#'   calculated (see 'Details'). All remaining covariates that are not specified
#'   in `terms` are held constant (see 'Details'). See also arguments `condition`
#'   and `typical`.
#' @param ci_level Numeric, the level of the confidence intervals. For `ggpredict()`,
#'   use `ci_level = NA`, if confidence intervals should not be calculated
#'   (for instance, due to computation time). Typically, confidence intervals
#'   based on the standard errors as returned by the `predict()` function
#'   are returned, assuming normal distribution (i.e. `+/- 1.96 * SE`).
#'   See introduction of [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/ggeffects.html)
#'   for more details.
#' @param type Character, indicating whether predictions should be conditioned
#'   on specific model components or not. Consequently, most options only apply
#'   for survival models, mixed effects models and/or models with zero-inflation
#'   (and their Bayesian counter-parts); only exeption is `type = "simulate"`,
#'   which is available for some other model classes as well (which respond to
#'   `simulate()`). **Note:** For `brmsfit`-models with zero-inflation component,
#'   there is no `type = "zero_inflated"` nor `type = "zi_random"`; predicted
#'   values for `MixMod`-models from **GLMMadaptive** with zero-inflation
#'   component *always* condition on the zero-inflation part of the model (see
#'   'Details').
#'
#'   - `"fixed"` (or `"fe"` or `"count"`)
#'
#'     Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects or conditional
#'     model only (for mixed models: predicted values are on the population-level
#'     and *confidence intervals* are returned, i.e. `re.form = NA` when calling
#'     `predict()`). For instance, for models fitted with `zeroinfl` from **pscl**,
#'     this would return the predicted mean from the count component (without
#'     zero-inflation). For models with zero-inflation component, this type calls
#'     `predict(..., type = "link")` (however, predicted values are
#'     back-transformed to the response scale).
#'
#'   - `"fixed_ppd"`
#'
#'     Only applies to `ggpredict()`, and only for Bayesian models of class
#'     `stanreg` or `brmsfit`. Computes the posterior predictive distribution.
#'     It is the same as setting `type = "fixed"` in combination with
#'     `ppd = TRUE`.
#'
#'   - `"random"` (or `"re"`)
#'
#'     This only applies to mixed models, and `type = "random"` does not condition
#'     on the zero-inflation component of the model. `type = "random"` still
#'     returns population-level predictions, however, conditioned on random effects
#'     and considering individual level predictions, i.e. `re.form = NULL` when
#'     calling `predict()`. This may affect the returned predicted values, depending
#'     on whether `REML = TRUE` or `REML = FALSE` was used for model fitting.
#'     Furthermore, unlike `type = "fixed"`, intervals also consider the uncertainty
#'     in the variance parameters (the mean random effect variance, see *Johnson
#'     et al. 2014* for details) and hence can be considered as *prediction intervals*.
#'     For models with zero-inflation component, this type calls
#'     `predict(..., type = "link")` (however, predicted values are back-transformed
#'     to the response scale).
#'
#'     To get predicted values for each level of the random effects groups, add the
#'     name of the related random effect term to the `terms`-argument
#'     (for more details, see
#'     [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html)).
#'
#'   - `"random_ppd"`
#'
#'     Only applies to `ggpredict()`, and only for Bayesian models of class
#'     `stanreg` or `brmsfit`. Computes the posterior predictive distribution.
#'     It is the same as setting `type = "random"` in combination with
#'     `ppd = TRUE`.
#'
#'   - `"zero_inflated"` (or `"fe.zi"` or `"zi"`)
#'
#'     Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects and the zero-inflation
#'     component. For instance, for models fitted with `zeroinfl`
#'     from **pscl**, this would return the predicted response (`mu*(1-p)`)
#'     and for **glmmTMB**, this would return the expected value `mu*(1-p)`
#'     *without* conditioning on random effects (i.e. random effect variances
#'     are not taken into account for the confidence intervals). For models with
#'     zero-inflation component, this type calls `predict(..., type = "response")`.
#'     See 'Details'.
#'
#'   - `"zi_random"` (or `"re.zi"` or `"zero_inflated_random"`)
#'
#'     Predicted values are conditioned on the zero-inflation component and
#'     take the random effects uncertainty into account. For models fitted with
#'     `glmmTMB()`, `hurdle()` or `zeroinfl()`, this would return the
#'     expected value `mu*(1-p)`. For **glmmTMB**, prediction intervals
#'     also consider the uncertainty in the random effects variances. This
#'     type calls `predict(..., type = "response")`. See 'Details'.
#'
#'   - `"zi_prob"` (or `"zi.prob"`)
#'
#'     Predicted zero-inflation probability. For **glmmTMB** models with
#'     zero-inflation component, this type calls `predict(..., type = "zlink")`;
#'     models from **pscl** call `predict(..., type = "zero")` and for
#'     **GLMMadaptive**, `predict(..., type = "zero_part")` is called.
#'
#'   - `"simulate"` (or `"sim"`)
#'
#'     Predicted values and confidence resp. prediction intervals are
#'     based on simulations, i.e. calls to `simulate()`. This type
#'     of prediction takes all model uncertainty into account, including
#'     random effects variances. Currently supported models are objects of
#'     class `lm`, `glm`, `glmmTMB`, `wbm`, `MixMod`
#'     and `merMod`. See `...` for details on number of simulations.
#'
#'   - `"survival"` and `"cumulative_hazard"` (or `"surv"` and `"cumhaz"`)
#'
#'     Applies only to `coxph`-objects from the **survial**-package and
#'     calculates the survival probability or the cumulative hazard of an event.
#'
#' @param typical Character vector, naming the function to be applied to the
#'   covariates (non-focal terms) over which the effect is "averaged". The
#'   default is `"mean"`. Can be `"mean"`, "`weighted.mean`", `"median"`, `"mode"`
#'   or `"zero"`, which call the corresponding R functions (except `"mode"`,
#'   which calls an internal function to compute the most common value); `"zero"`
#'   simply returns 0. By default, if the covariate is a factor, only `"mode"` is
#'   applicable; for all other values (including the default, `"mean"`) the
#'   reference level is returned. For character vectors, only the mode is returned.
#'   You can use a named vector to apply different functions to integer, numeric and
#'   categorical covariates, e.g. `typical = c(numeric = "median", factor = "mode")`.
#'   If `typical` is `"weighted.mean"`, weights from the model are used. If no
#'   weights are available, the function falls back to `"mean"`.
#' @param back_transform Logical, if `TRUE` (the default), predicted values
#'   for log- or log-log transformed responses will be back-transformed to
#'   original response-scale.
#' @param ppd Logical, if `TRUE`, predictions for Stan-models are based on the
#'   posterior predictive distribution [`rstantools::posterior_predict()`]. If
#'   `FALSE` (the default), predictions are based on posterior draws of the linear
#'   predictor [`rstantools::posterior_linpred()`].
#' @param condition Named character vector, which indicates covariates that
#'   should be held constant at specific values. Unlike `typical`, which
#'   applies a function to the covariates to determine the value that is used
#'   to hold these covariates constant, `condition` can be used to define
#'   exact values, for instance `condition = c(covariate1 = 20, covariate2 = 5)`.
#'   See 'Examples'.
#' @param interval Type of interval calculation, can either be `"confidence"`
#'   (default) or `"prediction"`. May be abbreviated. Unlike *confidence intervals*,
#'   *prediction intervals* include the residual variance (sigma^2) to account for
#'   the uncertainty of predicted values. For mixed models, `interval = "prediction"`
#'   is the default for `type = "random"`. When `type = "fixed"`, the default is
#'   `interval = "confidence"`. Note that prediction intervals are not available
#'   for all models, but only for models that work with [`insight::get_sigma()`].
#' @param vcov_fun Variance-covariance matrix used to compute uncertainty
#'   estimates (e.g., for confidence intervals based on robust standard errors).
#'   This argument accepts a covariance matrix, a function which returns a
#'   covariance matrix, or a string which identifies the function to be used to
#'   compute the covariance matrix.
#'   * A (variance-covariance) matrix
#'   * A function which returns a covariance matrix (e.g., `stats::vcov()`)
#'   * A string which indicates the name of the `vcov*()`-function from the
#'     **sandwich** or **clubSandwich** packages, e.g. `vcov_fun = "vcovCL"`,
#'     which is used to compute (cluster) robust standard errors for predictions.
#'     If `NULL`, standard errors (and confidence intervals) for predictions are
#'     based on the standard errors as returned by the `predict()`-function.
#'     **Note** that probably not all model objects that work with `ggpredict()`
#'     are also supported by the **sandwich** or **clubSandwich** packages.
#'
#'   See details in [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/practical_robustestimation.html).
#' @param vcov_type Character vector, specifying the estimation type for the
#'   robust covariance matrix estimation (see `?sandwich::vcovHC`
#'   or `?clubSandwich::vcovCR` for details). Only used when `vcov_fun` is a
#'   character string indicating on of the function from those packages.
#' @param vcov_args List of named vectors, used as additional arguments that
#'   are passed down to `vcov_fun`.
#' @param verbose Toggle messages or warnings.
#' @param ci.lvl,vcov.fun,vcov.type,vcov.args,back.transform Deprecated arguments.
#'   Please use `ci_level`, `vcov_fun`, `vcov_type`, `vcov_args` and `back_transform`
#'   instead.
#' @param ... For `ggpredict()`, further arguments passed down to `predict()`;
#'   for `ggeffect()`, further arguments passed down to `effects::Effect()`; for
#'   `ggemmeans()`, further arguments passed down to `emmeans::emmeans()`; and
#'   for `ggaverage()`, further arguments passed down to
#'   `marginaleffects::avg_predictions()`.  If `type = "simulate"`, `...` may
#'   also be used to set the number of simulation, e.g. `nsim = 500`.

#' @details
#' **Supported Models**
#'
#' A list of supported models can be found at [the package website](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects).
#' Support for models varies by function, i.e. although `ggpredict()`,
#' `ggemmeans()` and `ggeffect()` support most models, some models
#' are only supported exclusively by one of the three functions.
#'
#' **Difference between `ggpredict()` and `ggeffect()` or `ggemmeans()`**
#'
#' `ggpredict()` calls `predict()`, while `ggeffect()` calls `effects::Effect()`
#' and `ggemmeans()` calls `emmeans::emmeans()` to compute predicted values.
#' Thus, effects returned by `ggpredict()` can be described as *conditional effects*
#' (i.e. these are conditioned on certain (reference) levels of factors), while
#' `ggemmeans()` and `ggeffect()` return *marginal means*, since
#' the effects are "marginalized" (or "averaged") over the levels of factors
#' (or values of character vectors). Therefore, `ggpredict()` and `ggeffect()`
#' resp. `ggemmeans()` differ in how factors and character vectors are held
#' constant: `ggpredict()` uses the reference level (or "lowest" value in case
#' of character vectors), while `ggeffect()` and `ggemmeans()` compute a
#' kind of "average" value, which represents the proportions of each factor's
#' category. Use `condition` to set a specific level for factors in
#' `ggemmeans()`, so factors are not averaged over their categories,
#' but held constant at a given level.
#'
#' **Difference between `ggemmeans()` and `ggaverage()`**
#'
#' Estimated marginal means, as computed by `ggemmeans()` or `ggeffect()`, are a
#' special case of predictions, made on a perfectly balanced grid of categorical
#' predictors, with numeric predictors held at their means, and marginalized with
#' respect to some focal variables. `ggaverage()` calculates predicted values
#' for each observation in the data multiple times, each time fixing all values
#' or levels of the focal terms to and then takes the average of these predicted
#' values (aggregated/grouped by the focal terms). There is no rule of thumb
#' which approach is better; it depends on the characteristics of the sample and
#' the population to which should be generalized. Consulting the
#' [marginaleffects-website](https://marginaleffects.com/) might help to decide
#' which approach is more appropriate. The most apparent difference is how
#' *non-focal* categorical predictors affect the predicted values. `ggpredict()`
#' will condition on a certain level of the non-focal factors (usually, the reference
#' level), `ggemmeans()` will "average" over the levels of non-focal factors,
#' while `ggaverage()` will average over the observations in your sample. See also
#' [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/technical_differencepredictemmeans.html)
#' for details and examples.
#'
#' **Marginal Effects and Adjusted Predictions at Specific Values**
#'
#' Meaningful values of focal terms can be specified via the `terms` argument.
#' Specifying meaningful or representative values as string pattern is the
#' preferred way in the **ggeffects** package. However, it is also possible to
#' use a `list()` for the focal terms if prefer the "classical" R way, which is
#' described in [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html).
#'
#' Indicating levels in square brackets allows for selecting only certain
#' groups or values resp. value ranges. The term name and the start of the
#' levels in brackets must be separated by a whitespace character, e.g.
#' `terms = c("age", "education [1,3]")`. Numeric ranges, separated with colon,
#' are also allowed: `terms = c("education", "age [30:60]")`. The stepsize for
#' ranges can be adjusted using `by`, e.g. `terms = "age [30:60 by=5]"`.
#'
#' The `terms` argument also supports the same shortcuts as the `values` argument
#' in `values_at()`. So `terms = "age [meansd]"` would return predictions for
#' the values one standard deviation below the mean age, the mean age and one SD
#' above the mean age. `terms = "age [quart2]"` would calculate predictions at
#' the value of the lower, median and upper quartile of age.
#'
#' Furthermore, it is possible to specify a function name. Values for predictions
#' will then be transformed, e.g. `terms = "income [exp]"`. This is useful when
#' model predictors were transformed for fitting the model and should be
#' back-transformed to the original scale for predictions. It is also possible
#' to define own functions (see
#' [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html)).
#'
#' Instead of a function, it is also possible to define the name of a variable
#' with specific values, e.g. to define a vector `v = c(1000, 2000, 3000)` and
#' then use `terms = "income [v]"`.
#'
#' You can take a random sample of any size with `sample=n`, e.g
#' `terms = "income [sample=8]"`, which will sample eight values from
#' all possible values of the variable `income`. This option is especially
#' useful for plotting predictions at certain levels of random effects
#' group levels, where the group factor has many levels that can be completely
#' plotted. For more details, see
#' [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html).
#'
#' Finally, numeric vectors for which no specific values are given, a "pretty range"
#' is calculated (see [`pretty_range()`]), to avoid memory allocation problems
#' for vectors with many unique values. If a numeric vector is specified as
#' second or third term (i.e. if this vector represents a grouping structure),
#' representative values (see [`values_at()`]) are chosen (unless other values
#' are specified). If all values for a numeric vector should be used to compute
#' predictions, you may use e.g. `terms = "age [all]"`. See also package vignettes.
#'
#' To create a pretty range that should be smaller or larger than the default
#' range (i.e. if no specific values would be given), use the `n` tag, e.g.
#' `terms="age [n=5]"` or `terms="age [n=12]"`. Larger values for `n` return a
#' larger range of predicted values.
#'
#' **Holding covariates at constant values**
#'
#' For `ggpredict()`, a data grid is constructed, roughly comparable to
#' `expand.grid()` on all unique combinations of `model.frame(model)[, terms]`.
#' This data grid (see [`data_grid()`]) as `newdata` argument for `predict()`.
#' In this case, all remaining covariates that are not specified in `terms` are
#' held constant: Numeric values are set to the mean (unless changed with
#' the `condition` or `typical` argument), integer values are set to their
#' median, factors are set to their reference level (may also be changed with
#' `condition`) and character vectors to their mode (most common element).
#'
#' `ggeffect()` and `ggemmeans()`, by default, set remaining numeric covariates
#' to their mean value, while for factors, a kind of "average" value, which
#' represents the proportions of each factor's category, is used. The same
#' applies to character vectors: `ggemmeans()` averages over the distribution
#' of unique values in a character vector, similar to how factors are treated.
#' Thus, *non-focal categorical terms* in `ggemmeans()` and `ggeffect()` are
#' conditioned on "weighted averages" of their levels. For `ggemmeans()`, use
#' `condition` to set a specific level for factors so that these are not
#' averaged over their categories, but held constant at the given level.
#'
#' Finally, `ggaverage()` calculates *average predicted values*, which are
#' averaged over the full sample and aggregated by (representative values of)
#' the focal terms. For further details, see
#' [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/technical_differencepredictemmeans.html).
#'
#' **Bayesian Regression Models**
#'
#' `ggpredict()` also works with **Stan**-models from the **rstanarm** or
#' **brms**-packages. The predicted values are the median value of all drawn
#' posterior samples. The confidence intervals for Stan-models are Bayesian
#' predictive intervals. By default (i.e. `ppd = FALSE`), the predictions are
#' based on [`rstantools::posterior_linpred()`] and hence have some limitations:
#' the uncertainty of the error term is not taken into account. The recommendation
#' is to use the posterior predictive distribution ([`rstantools::posterior_predict()`]).
#'
#' **Zero-Inflated and Zero-Inflated Mixed Models with brms**
#'
#' Models of class `brmsfit` always condition on the zero-inflation component,
#' if the model has such a component. Hence, there is no `type = "zero_inflated"`
#' nor `type = "zi_random"` for `brmsfit`-models, because predictions are based
#' on draws of the posterior distribution, which already account for the
#' zero-inflation part of the model.
#'
#' **Zero-Inflated and Zero-Inflated Mixed Models with glmmTMB**
#'
#' If `model` is of class `glmmTMB`, `hurdle`, `zeroinfl` or `zerotrunc`,
#' simulations from a multivariate normal distribution (see `?MASS::mvrnorm`)
#' are drawn to calculate `mu*(1-p)`. Confidence intervals are then based on
#' quantiles of these results. For `type = "zi_random"`, prediction intervals
#' also take the uncertainty in the random-effect paramters into account (see
#' also _Brooks et al. 2017_, pp.391-392 for details).
#'
#' An alternative for models fitted with **glmmTMB** that take all model
#' uncertainties into account are simulations based on `simulate()`, which
#' is used when `type = "simulate"` (see _Brooks et al. 2017_, pp.392-393 for
#' details).
#'
#' **MixMod-models from GLMMadaptive**
#'
#' Predicted values for the fixed effects component (`type = "fixed"` or
#' `type = "zero_inflated"`) are based on `predict(..., type = "mean_subject")`,
#' while predicted values for random effects components (`type = "random"` or
#' `type = "zi_random"`) are calculated with `predict(..., type = "subject_specific")`
#' (see `?GLMMadaptive::predict.MixMod` for details). The latter option
#' requires the response variable to be defined in the `newdata`-argument
#' of `predict()`, which will be set to its typical value (see
#' [`values_at()`]).

#' @note
#' **Multinomial Models**
#'
#' `polr`, `clm` models, or more generally speaking, models with ordinal or
#' multinominal outcomes, have an additional column `response.level`, which
#' indicates with which level of the response variable the predicted values are
#' associated.
#'
#' **Printing Results**
#'
#' The `print()` method gives a clean output (especially for predictions by
#' groups), and indicates at which values covariates were held constant.
#' Furthermore, the `print()` method has the arguments `digits` and `n` to
#' control number of decimals and lines to be printed.
#'
#' **Limitations**
#'
#' The support for some models, for example from package **MCMCglmm**, is
#' rather experimental and may fail for certain models. If you encounter
#' any errors, please file an issue [at Github](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects/issues).
#'
#' @return A data frame (with `ggeffects` class attribute) with consistent data columns:
#'
#' - `"x"`: the values of the first term in `terms`, used as x-position in plots.
#' - `"predicted"`: the predicted values of the response, used as y-position in plots.
#' - `"std.error"`: the standard error of the predictions. *Note that the standard
#'    errors are always on the link-scale, and not back-transformed for non-Gaussian
#'    models!*
#' - `"conf.low"`: the lower bound of the confidence interval for the predicted values.
#' - `"conf.high"`: the upper bound of the confidence interval for the predicted values.
#' - `"group"`: the grouping level from the second term in `terms`, used as
#'     grouping-aesthetics in plots.
#' - `"facet"`: the grouping level from the third term in `terms`, used to indicate
#'     facets in plots.
#'
#'   The estimated marginal means (or predicted values) are always on the
#'   response scale!
#'
#'   For proportional odds logistic regression (see `?MASS::polr`)
#'   resp. cumulative link models (e.g., see `?ordinal::clm`),
#'   an additional column `"response.level"` is returned, which indicates
#'   the grouping of predictions based on the level of the model's response.
#'
#'   Note that for convenience reasons, the columns for the intervals
#'   are always named `"conf.low"` and `"conf.high"`, even though
#'   for Bayesian models credible or highest posterior density intervals
#'   are returned.
#'
#'   There is an [`as.data.frame()`] method for objects of class `ggeffects`,
#'   which has an `terms_to_colnames` argument, to use the term names as column
#'   names instead of the standardized names `"x"` etc.
