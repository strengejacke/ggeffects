#' @title Adjusted predictions and estimated marginal means from regression models
#' @name predict_response
#'
#' @description
#' The **ggeffects** package computes marginal means and adjusted predicted
#' values for the response, at the margin of specific values or levels from
#' certain model terms. The package is built around three core functions:
#' `predict_response()` (understanding results), `test_predictions()` (testing
#' results for statistically significant differences) and `plot()` (communicate
#' results).
#'
#' By default, adjusted predictions or marginal means are returned on the
#' *response* scale, which is the easiest and most intuitive scale to interpret
#' the results. There are other options for specific models as well, e.g. with
#' zero-inflation component (see documentation of the `type`-argument). The
#' result is returned as structured data frame, which is nicely printed by
#' default. `plot()` can be used to easily create figures.
#'
#' The main function to calculate marginal means and adjusted predictions is
#' `predict_response()`, which returns adjusted predictions, marginal means
#' or averaged counterfactual predictions depending on value of the
#' `margin`-argument.
#'
#' In previous versions of **ggeffects**, the functions `ggpredict()`, `ggemmeans()`,
#' `ggeffect()` and `ggaverage()` were used to calculate marginal means and
#' adjusted predictions. These functions are still available, but `predict_response()`
#' as a "wrapper" around these functions is the preferred way to calculate marginal
#' means and adjusted predictions now.
#'
#' @param model A model object.
#' @param terms Names of those terms from `model`, for which predictions should
#' be displayed (so called _focal terms_). Can be:
#'   - A character vector, specifying the names of the focal terms. This is the
#'     preferred and probably most flexible way to specify focal terms, e.g.
#'     `terms = "x [40:60]"`, to calculate predictions for the values 40 to 60.
#'   - A list, where each element is a named vector, specifying the focal terms
#'     and their values. This is the "classical" R way to specify focal terms,
#'     e.g. `list(x = 40:60)`.
#'   - A formula, e.g. `terms = ~ x + z`, which is internally converted to a
#'     character vector. This is probably the least flexible way, as you cannot
#'     specify representative values for the focal terms.
#'   - A data frame representig a "data grid" or "reference grid". Predictions
#'     are then made for all combinations of the variables in the data frame.
#'
#' `term` at least requires one variable name. The maximum length is four terms,
#' where the second to fourth term indicate the groups, i.e. predictions of first
#' term are grouped at meaningful values or levels of the remaining terms (see
#' [`values_at()`]). It is also possible to define specific values for focal
#' terms, at which adjusted predictions should be calculated (see details below).
#' All remaining covariates that are not specified in `terms` are "marginalized",
#' see the `margin` argument. See also argument `condition` to fix non-focal
#' terms to specific values.
#' @param ci_level Numeric, the level of the confidence intervals. Use
#' `ci_level = NA` if confidence intervals should not be calculated
#' (for instance, due to computation time). Typically, confidence intervals are
#' based on the returned standard errors for the predictions, assuming a t- or
#' normal distribution (based on the model and the available degrees of freedom,
#' i.e. roughly `+/- 1.96 * SE`). See introduction of
#' [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/ggeffects.html)
#' for more details.
#' @param type Character, indicating whether predictions should be conditioned
#' on specific model components or not. Consequently, most options only apply
#' for survival models, mixed effects models and/or models with zero-inflation
#' (and their Bayesian counter-parts); only exeption is `type = "simulate"`,
#' which is available for some other model classes as well (which respond to
#' `simulate()`).
#'
#' **Note 1:** For `brmsfit`-models with zero-inflation component,
#' there is no `type = "zero_inflated"` nor `type = "zi_random"`; predicted
#' values for `MixMod`-models from **GLMMadaptive** with zero-inflation
#' component *always* condition on the zero-inflation part of the model (see
#' 'Details').
#'
#' **Note 2:** If `margin = "empirical"` (i.e. counterfactual predictions), the
#' `type` argument is handled differently. It is set to `"response"` by default,
#' and usually accepts all values from the `type`-argument of the model's respective
#' `predict()` method. E.g., passing a `glm` object would allow the options
#' `"response"`, `"link"`, and `"terms"`. Thus, the following options apply to
#' `predict_response()` when `margin` is _not_ `"empirical"`, and are passed to
#' `ggpredict()` or `ggemmeans()`, respectively (depending on the value of `margin`):
#'
#'   - `"fixed"` (or `"fe"` or `"count"`)
#'
#'     Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects or conditional
#'     model only (for mixed models: predicted values are on the population-level
#'     and *confidence intervals* are returned, i.e. `re.form = NA` when calling
#'     `predict()`). For instance, for models fitted with `zeroinfl` from **pscl**,
#'     this would return the predicted mean from the count component (without
#'     zero-inflation). For models with zero-inflation component, this type calls
#'     `predict(..., type = "link")` (however, predicted values are
#'     back-transformed to the response scale).
#'
#'   - `"fixed_ppd"`
#'
#'     Only applies to `margin = "mean_reference"`, and only for Bayesian
#'     models of class `stanreg` or `brmsfit`. Computes the posterior predictive
#'     distribution. It is the same as setting `type = "fixed"` in combination with
#'     `ppd = TRUE`.
#'
#'   - `"random"` (or `"re"`)
#'
#'     This only applies to mixed models, and `type = "random"` does not condition
#'     on the zero-inflation component of the model. `type = "random"` still
#'     returns population-level predictions, however, conditioned on random effects
#'     and considering individual level predictions, i.e. `re.form = NULL` when
#'     calling `predict()`. This may affect the returned predicted values, depending
#'     on whether `REML = TRUE` or `REML = FALSE` was used for model fitting.
#'     Furthermore, unlike `type = "fixed"`, intervals also consider the uncertainty
#'     in the variance parameters (the mean random effect variance, see *Johnson
#'     et al. 2014* for details) and hence can be considered as *prediction intervals*.
#'     For models with zero-inflation component, this type calls
#'     `predict(..., type = "link")` (however, predicted values are back-transformed
#'     to the response scale).
#'
#'     To get predicted values for each level of the random effects groups, add the
#'     name of the related random effect term to the `terms`-argument
#'     (for more details, see
#'     [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html)).
#'
#'   - `"random_ppd"`
#'
#'     Only applies to `margin = "mean_reference"`,, and only for Bayesian
#'     models of class `stanreg` or `brmsfit`. Computes the posterior predictive
#'     distribution. It is the same as setting `type = "random"` in combination with
#'     `ppd = TRUE`.
#'
#'   - `"zero_inflated"` (or `"fe.zi"` or `"zi"`)
#'
#'     Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects and the zero-inflation
#'     component. For instance, for models fitted with `zeroinfl`
#'     from **pscl**, this would return the predicted response (`mu*(1-p)`)
#'     and for **glmmTMB**, this would return the expected value `mu*(1-p)`
#'     *without* conditioning on random effects (i.e. random effect variances
#'     are not taken into account for the confidence intervals). For models with
#'     zero-inflation component, this type calls `predict(..., type = "response")`.
#'     See 'Details'.
#'
#'   - `"zi_random"` (or `"re.zi"` or `"zero_inflated_random"`)
#'
#'     Predicted values are conditioned on the zero-inflation component and
#'     take the random effects uncertainty into account. For models fitted with
#'     `glmmTMB()`, `hurdle()` or `zeroinfl()`, this would return the
#'     expected value `mu*(1-p)`. For **glmmTMB**, prediction intervals
#'     also consider the uncertainty in the random effects variances. This
#'     type calls `predict(..., type = "response")`. See 'Details'.
#'
#'   - `"zi_prob"` (or `"zi.prob"`)
#'
#'     Predicted zero-inflation probability. For **glmmTMB** models with
#'     zero-inflation component, this type calls `predict(..., type = "zlink")`;
#'     models from **pscl** call `predict(..., type = "zero")` and for
#'     **GLMMadaptive**, `predict(..., type = "zero_part")` is called.
#'
#'   - `"simulate"` (or `"sim"`)
#'
#'     Predicted values and confidence resp. prediction intervals are
#'     based on simulations, i.e. calls to `simulate()`. This type
#'     of prediction takes all model uncertainty into account, including
#'     random effects variances. Currently supported models are objects of
#'     class `lm`, `glm`, `glmmTMB`, `wbm`, `MixMod`
#'     and `merMod`. See `...` for details on number of simulations.
#'
#'   - `"survival"` and `"cumulative_hazard"` (or `"surv"` and `"cumhaz"`)
#'
#'     Applies only to `coxph`-objects from the **survial**-package and
#'     calculates the survival probability or the cumulative hazard of an event.
#'
#' When `margin = "empirical"`, the `type` argument accepts all values from
#' the `type`-argument of the model's respective `predict()`-method.
#'
#' @param margin Character string, indicating how to marginalize over the
#' *non-focal* predictors, i.e. those variables that are *not* specified in
#' `terms`. Possible values are `"mean_reference"`, `"mean_mode"`,
#' `"marginalmeans"` and `"empirical"` (or `"counterfactual"`, aka average
#' "counterfactual" predictions). You can set a default-option for the `margin`
#' argument via `options()`, e.g. `options(ggeffects_margin = "empirical")`,
#' so you don't have to specify your preferred marginalization method each time
#' you call `predict_response()`. See details in the documentation below.
#' @param back_transform Logical, if `TRUE` (the default), predicted values
#' for log- or log-log transformed responses will be back-transformed to
#' original response-scale.
#' @param ppd Logical, if `TRUE`, predictions for Stan-models are based on the
#' posterior predictive distribution [`rstantools::posterior_predict()`]. If
#' `FALSE` (the default), predictions are based on posterior draws of the linear
#' predictor [`rstantools::posterior_linpred()`].
#' @param condition Named character vector, which indicates covariates that
#' should be held constant at specific values. Unlike `typical`, which
#' applies a function to the covariates to determine the value that is used
#' to hold these covariates constant, `condition` can be used to define
#' exact values, for instance `condition = c(covariate1 = 20, covariate2 = 5)`.
#' See 'Examples'.
#' @param interval Type of interval calculation, can either be `"confidence"`
#' (default) or `"prediction"`. May be abbreviated. Unlike *confidence intervals*,
#' *prediction intervals* include the residual variance (sigma^2) to account for
#' the uncertainty of predicted values. For mixed models, `interval = "prediction"`
#' is the default for `type = "random"`. When `type = "fixed"`, the default is
#' `interval = "confidence"`. Note that prediction intervals are not available
#' for all models, but only for models that work with [`insight::get_sigma()`].
#' @param vcov_fun Variance-covariance matrix used to compute uncertainty
#' estimates (e.g., for confidence intervals based on robust standard errors).
#' This argument accepts a covariance matrix, a function which returns a
#' covariance matrix, or a string which identifies the function to be used to
#' compute the covariance matrix.
#' * A (variance-covariance) matrix
#' * A function which returns a covariance matrix (e.g., `stats::vcov()`)
#' * A string which indicates the estimation type for the heteroscedasticity-consistent
#'   variance-covariance matrix, e.g. `vcov_fun = "HC0"`. Possible values are
#'   `"HC0"`, `"HC1"`, `"HC2"`, `"HC3"`, `"HC4"`, `"HC4m"`, and `"HC5"`, which
#'   will then call the `vcovHC()`-function from the **sandwich** package, using
#'   the specified type. Further possible values are `"CR0"`, `"CR1"`, `"CR1p"`,
#'   `"CR1S"`, `"CR2"`, and `"CR3"`, which will call the `vcovCR()`-function from
#'   the **clubSandwich** package.
#' * A string which indicates the name of the `vcov*()`-function from the
#'   **sandwich** or **clubSandwich** packages, e.g. `vcov_fun = "vcovCL"`,
#'   which is used to compute (cluster) robust standard errors for predictions.
#'
#' If `NULL`, standard errors (and confidence intervals) for predictions are
#' based on the standard errors as returned by the `predict()`-function.
#' **Note** that probably not all model objects that work with `ggpredict()`
#' are also supported by the **sandwich** or **clubSandwich** packages.
#'
#' See details in [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/practical_robustestimation.html).
#' @param vcov_type Character vector, specifying the estimation type for the
#' robust covariance matrix estimation (see `?sandwich::vcovHC`
#' or `?clubSandwich::vcovCR` for details). Only used when `vcov_fun` is a
#' character string indicating one of the functions from those packages.
#' @param vcov_args List of named vectors, used as additional arguments that
#' are passed down to `vcov_fun`.
#' @param weights Character vector, naming the weigthing variable in the data,
#' or a vector of weights (of same length as the number of observations in the
#' data). Only applies to `margin = "empirical"`.
#' @param verbose Toggle messages or warnings.
#' @param ... If `margin` is set to `"mean_reference"` or `"mean_mode"`, arguments
#' are passed down to `ggpredict()` (further down to `predict()`); for
#' `margin = "marginalmeans"`, further arguments passed down to `ggemmeans()` and
#' thereby to `emmeans::emmeans()`; if `margin = "empirical"`, further arguments are
#' passed down to `marginaleffects::avg_predictions()`. If `type = "simulate"`,
#' `...` may also be used to set the number of simulation, e.g. `nsim = 500`.
#' When calling `ggeffect()`, further arguments passed down to `effects::Effect()`.
#'
#' @section Supported Models:
#'
#' A list of supported models can be found at [the package website](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects).
#' Support for models varies by marginalization method (the `margin` argument),
#' i.e. although `predict_response()` supports most models, some models are only
#' supported exclusively by one of the four downstream functions (`ggpredict()`,
#' `ggemmeans()`, `ggeffect()` or `ggaverage()`). This means that not all models
#' work for every `margin` option of `predict_response()`.
#'
#' @section Holding covariates at constant values, or how marginalize over the *non-focal* predictors:
#'
#' `predict_response()` is a wrapper around `ggpredict()`, `ggemmeans()` and
#' `ggaverage()`. Depending on the value of the `margin` argument,
#' `predict_response()` calls one of those functions. The `margin` argument
#' indicates how to marginalize over the *non-focal* predictors, i.e. those
#' variables that are *not* specified in `terms`. Possible values are:
#'
#' - `"mean_reference"` and `"mean_mode"`: For `"mean_reference"`, non-focal
#'   predictors are set to their mean (numeric variables), reference level
#'   (factors), or "most common" value (mode) in case of character vectors.
#'   For `"mean_mode"`, non-focal predictors are set to their mean (numeric
#'   variables) or mode (factors, or "most common" value in case of character
#'   vectors).
#'
#'   These predictons represent a rather "theoretical" view on your data,
#'   which does not necessarily exactly reflect the characteristics of your
#'   sample. It helps answer the question, "What is the predicted value of the
#'   response at meaningful values or levels of my focal terms for a 'typical'
#'   observation in my data?", where 'typical' refers to certain characteristics
#'   of the remaining predictors.
#'
#' - `"marginalmeans"`: non-focal predictors are set to their mean (numeric
#'   variables) or averaged over the levels or "values" for factors and
#'   character vectors. Averaging over the factor levels of non-focal terms
#'   computes a kind of "weighted average" for the values at which these terms
#'   are hold constant. Thus, non-focal categorical terms are conditioned on
#'   "weighted averages" of their levels.
#'
#'   These predictions come closer to the sample, because all possible values
#'   and levels of the non-focal predictors are taken  into account. It would
#'   answer the question, "What is the predicted value of the response at
#'   meaningful values or levels of my focal terms for an 'average' observation
#'   in my data?". It refers to randomly picking a subject of your sample and
#'   the result you get on average.
#'
#' - `"empirical"` (or `"counterfactual"`): non-focal predictors are averaged
#'   over the observations in the sample. The response is predicted for each
#'   subject in the data and predicted values are then averaged across all
#'   subjects, aggregated/grouped by the focal terms. In particular, averaging
#'   is applied to _counterfactual predictions_ (Dickerman and Hernan 2020).
#'   There is a more detailed description in
#'   [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/technical_differencepredictemmeans.html).
#'
#'   Counterfactual predictions are useful, insofar as the results can also
#'   be transferred to other contexts. It answers the question, "What is the
#'   predicted value of the response at meaningful values or levels of my focal
#'   terms for the 'average' observation in the population?". It does not only
#'   refer to the actual data in your sample, but also "what would be if" we had
#'   more data, or if we had data from a different population. This is where
#'   "counterfactual" refers to.
#'
#' You can set a default-option for the `margin` argument via `options()`, e.g.
#' `options(ggeffects_margin = "empirical")`, so you don't have to specify your
#' "default" marginalization method each time you call `predict_response()`.
#' Use `options(ggeffects_margin = NULL)` to remove that setting.
#'
#' The `condition` argument can be used to fix non-focal terms to specific
#' values.
#'
#' @section Marginal Means and Adjusted Predictions at Specific Values:
#'
#' Meaningful values of focal terms can be specified via the `terms` argument.
#' Specifying meaningful or representative values as string pattern is the
#' preferred way in the **ggeffects** package. However, it is also possible to
#' use a `list()` for the focal terms if prefer the "classical" R way, which is
#' described in [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html).
#'
#' Indicating levels in square brackets allows for selecting only certain
#' groups or values resp. value ranges. The term name and the start of the
#' levels in brackets must be separated by a whitespace character, e.g.
#' `terms = c("age", "education [1,3]")`. Numeric ranges, separated with colon,
#' are also allowed: `terms = c("education", "age [30:60]")`. The stepsize for
#' ranges can be adjusted using `by`, e.g. `terms = "age [30:60 by=5]"`.
#'
#' The `terms` argument also supports the same shortcuts as the `values` argument
#' in `values_at()`. So `terms = "age [meansd]"` would return predictions for
#' the values one standard deviation below the mean age, the mean age and one SD
#' above the mean age. `terms = "age [quart2]"` would calculate predictions at
#' the value of the lower, median and upper quartile of age.
#'
#' Furthermore, it is possible to specify a function name. Values for predictions
#' will then be transformed, e.g. `terms = "income [exp]"`. This is useful when
#' model predictors were transformed for fitting the model and should be
#' back-transformed to the original scale for predictions. It is also possible
#' to define own functions (see
#' [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html)).
#'
#' Instead of a function, it is also possible to define the name of a variable
#' with specific values, e.g. to define a vector `v = c(1000, 2000, 3000)` and
#' then use `terms = "income [v]"`.
#'
#' You can take a random sample of any size with `sample=n`, e.g
#' `terms = "income [sample=8]"`, which will sample eight values from
#' all possible values of the variable `income`. This option is especially
#' useful for plotting predictions at certain levels of random effects
#' group levels, where the group factor has many levels that can be completely
#' plotted. For more details, see
#' [this vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_effectsatvalues.html).
#'
#' Finally, numeric vectors for which no specific values are given, a "pretty range"
#' is calculated (see [`pretty_range()`]), to avoid memory allocation problems
#' for vectors with many unique values. If a numeric vector is specified as
#' second or third term (i.e. if this vector represents a grouping structure),
#' representative values (see [`values_at()`]) are chosen (unless other values
#' are specified). If all values for a numeric vector should be used to compute
#' predictions, you may use e.g. `terms = "age [all]"`. See also package vignettes.
#'
#' To create a pretty range that should be smaller or larger than the default
#' range (i.e. if no specific values would be given), use the `n` tag, e.g.
#' `terms="age [n=5]"` or `terms="age [n=12]"`. Larger values for `n` return a
#' larger range of predicted values.
#'
#' @section Bayesian Regression Models:
#'
#' `predict_response()` also works with **Stan**-models from the **rstanarm** or
#' **brms**-packages. The predicted values are the median value of all drawn
#' posterior samples. The confidence intervals for Stan-models are Bayesian
#' predictive intervals. By default (i.e. `ppd = FALSE`), the predictions are
#' based on [`rstantools::posterior_linpred()`] and hence have some limitations:
#' the uncertainty of the error term is not taken into account. The recommendation
#' is to use the posterior predictive distribution ([`rstantools::posterior_predict()`]).
#'
#' @section Zero-Inflated and Zero-Inflated Mixed Models with brms:
#'
#' Models of class `brmsfit` always condition on the zero-inflation component,
#' if the model has such a component. Hence, there is no `type = "zero_inflated"`
#' nor `type = "zi_random"` for `brmsfit`-models, because predictions are based
#' on draws of the posterior distribution, which already account for the
#' zero-inflation part of the model.
#'
#' **Zero-Inflated and Zero-Inflated Mixed Models with glmmTMB**
#'
#' If `model` is of class `glmmTMB`, `hurdle`, `zeroinfl` or `zerotrunc`, and
#' `margin` is _not_ set to `"empirical`,  simulations from a multivariate
#' normal distribution (see `?MASS::mvrnorm`) are drawn to calculate `mu*(1-p)`.
#' Confidence intervals are then based on quantiles of these results.
#' For `type = "zi_random"`, prediction intervals also take the uncertainty in
#' the random-effect paramters into account (see also _Brooks et al. 2017_,
#' pp.391-392 for details).
#'
#' An alternative for models fitted with **glmmTMB** that take all model
#' uncertainties into account are simulations based on `simulate()`, which
#' is used when `type = "simulate"` (see _Brooks et al. 2017_, pp.392-393 for
#' details).
#'
#' Finally, if `margin = "empirical"`, the returned predictions are already
#' conditioned on the zero-inflation part (and possible random effects) of the
#' model, thus these are most comparable to the `type = "simulate"` option. In
#' other words, if all model components should be taken into account for
#' predictions, you should consider using `margin = "empirical"`.
#'
#' @section MixMod-models from GLMMadaptive:
#'
#' Predicted values for the fixed effects component (`type = "fixed"` or
#' `type = "zero_inflated"`) are based on `predict(..., type = "mean_subject")`,
#' while predicted values for random effects components (`type = "random"` or
#' `type = "zi_random"`) are calculated with `predict(..., type = "subject_specific")`
#' (see `?GLMMadaptive::predict.MixMod` for details). The latter option
#' requires the response variable to be defined in the `newdata`-argument
#' of `predict()`, which will be set to its typical value (see
#' [`values_at()`]).
#'
#' @section Multinomial Models:
#'
#' `polr`, `clm` models, or more generally speaking, models with ordinal or
#' multinominal outcomes, have an additional column `response.level`, which
#' indicates with which level of the response variable the predicted values are
#' associated.

#' - `"group"`: the grouping level from the second term in `terms`, used as
#'     grouping-aesthetics in plots.
#' - `"facet"`: the grouping level from the third term in `terms`, used to indicate
#'     facets in plots.
#'
#'   The estimated marginal means (or predicted values) are always on the
#'   response scale!
#'
#'   For proportional odds logistic regression (see `?MASS::polr`)
#'   resp. cumulative link models (e.g., see `?ordinal::clm`),
#'   an additional column `"response.level"` is returned, which indicates
#'   the grouping of predictions based on the level of the model's response.
#'
#'   Note that for convenience reasons, the columns for the intervals
#'   are always named `"conf.low"` and `"conf.high"`, even though
#'   for Bayesian models credible or highest posterior density intervals
#'   are returned.
#'
#'   There is an [`as.data.frame()`] method for objects of class `ggeffects`,
#'   which has an `terms_to_colnames` argument, to use the term names as column
#'   names instead of the standardized names `"x"` etc.
