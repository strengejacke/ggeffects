```

This vignettes demonstrates how to customize plots created with the `plot()`-method of the **ggeffects**-package.

`plot()` returns an object of class **ggplot**, so it is easy to apply further modifications to the resulting plot. You may want to load the ggplot2-package to do this: `library(ggplot2)`.

Let's start with a default-plot:

```{r}
library(ggeffects)
library(ggplot2)

data(mtcars)
m <- lm(mpg ~ gear + as.factor(cyl) + wt, data = mtcars)

# continuous x-axis
dat <- predict_response(m, terms = c("gear", "wt"))

# discrete x-axis
dat_categorical <- predict_response(m, terms = c("cyl", "wt"))

# default plot
plot(dat)
```

## Changing Plot and Axis Titles

The simplest thing is to change the titles from the plot, x- and y-axis. This can be done with `ggplot2::labs()`:

```{r}
plot(dat) +
  labs(
    x = "Number of forward gears",
    y = "Miles/(US) gallon",
    title = "Predicted mean miles per gallon"
  )
```

## Changing the Legend Title

The legend-title can also be changed using the `labs()`-function. The legend in ggplot-objects refers to the aesthetic used for the grouping variable, which is by default the `colour`, i.e. the plot is constructed in the following way:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = predicted, colour = group))
```

### Plots with Default Colors

Hence, using `colour` in `labs()` changes the legend-title:

```{r}
plot(dat) + labs(colour = "Weight (1000 lbs)")
```

### Black-and-White Plots

For black-and-white plots, the group-aesthetic is mapped to different _linetypes_, not to different colours. Thus, the legend-title for black-and-white plots can be changed using `linetype` in `labs()`:

```{r}
plot(dat, colors = "bw") + labs(linetype = "Weight (1000 lbs)")
```

### Black-and-White Plots with Categorical Predictor 

If the variable on the x-axis is discrete for a black-and-white plot, the group-aesthetic is mapped to different _shapes_, so following code must be used to change the legend title:

```{r}
plot(dat_categorical, colors = "bw") + labs(shape = "Weight (1000 lbs)")
```

## Changing the x-Axis Appearance

The x-axis for plots returned from `plot()` is always _continuous_, even for discrete x-axis-variables. The reason for this is that many users are used to plots that connect the data points with lines, which is only possible for continuous x-axes. You can do this using the `connect.lines`-argument:

```{r}
plot(dat_categorical, connect.lines = TRUE)
```

### Categorical Predictors

Since the x-axis is continuous (i.e. `ggplot2::scale_x_continuous()`), you can use `scale_x_continuous()` to modify the x-axis, and change breaks, limits or labels.

```{r}
plot(dat_categorical) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = c("four", "six", "eight"), breaks = c(4, 6, 8))
```

### Continuous Predictors

Or for continuous variables:

```{r}
plot(dat) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 3:5, limits = c(2, 6))
```

## Changing the y-Axis Appearance

Arguments in `...` are passed down to `ggplot::scale_y_continuous()` (resp. `ggplot::scale_y_log10()`, if `log.y = TRUE`), so you can control the appearance of the y-axis by putting the arguments directly into the call to `plot()`:

```{r}
plot(dat_categorical, breaks = seq(12, 30, 2), limits = c(12, 30))
```

## Changing the Legend Labels

The legend labels can also be changed using a `scale_*()`-function from **ggplot**. Depending on the color-setting (see section **Changing the Legend Title**), following functions can be used to change the legend labels:

* `scale_colour_manual()` resp. `scale_colour_brewer()`
* `scale_linetype_manual()`
* `scale_shape_manual()`

Since you overwrite an exising "color" scale, you typically need to provide the `values` or `palette`-argument, to manuall set the colors, linetypes or shapes.

### Plots with Default Colors

For plots using default colors:

```{r}
plot(dat) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1", labels = c("-1 SD", "Mean", "+1 SD")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

### Black-and-White Plots

For black-and-white plots:

```{r}
plot(dat, colors = "bw") +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = 15:17, labels = c("-1 SD", "Mean", "+1 SD"))
```

### Black-and-White Plots with Categorical Predictor 

For black-and-white plots with categorical x-axis:

```{r}
plot(dat_categorical, colors = "bw") +
  scale_shape_manual(values = 1:3, labels = c("-1 SD", "Mean", "+1 SD"))
```
