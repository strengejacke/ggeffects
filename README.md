## Why do we need (marginal/conditional) effects or (adjusted) predicted values?

Results of regression models are typically presented as tables that are
easy to understand. For more complex models that include interaction or
quadratic / spline terms, tables with numbers are less helpful and
difficult to interpret. In such cases, *marginal effects* or *adjusted
predictions* are far easier to understand. In particular, the
visualization of such effects or predictions allows to intuitively get
the idea of how predictors and outcome are associated, even for complex
models.

## Aim of this package

**ggeffects** is a light-weight package that aims at easily calculating
marginal effects and adjusted predictions (or: *estimated marginal
means*) at the mean or at representative values of covariates ([see
definitions
here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/tags/marginal-effect/info)) from
statistical models, i.e. **predictions generated by a model when one
holds the non-focal variables constant and varies the focal
variable(s)**. This is achieved by three core ideas that describe the
philosophy of the function design:

1)  Functions are type-safe and always return a data frame with the
    same, consistent structure;

2)  there is a simple, unique approach to calculate marginal
    effects/adjusted predictions and estimated marginal means for many
    different models;

3)  the package supports “labelled data” (Lüdecke 2018), which allows
    human readable annotations for graphical outputs.

This means, users do not need to care about any expensive steps after
modeling to visualize the results. The returned as data frame is ready
to use with the **ggplot2**-package, however, there is also a
`plot()`-method to easily create publication-ready figures.

## Definition of “marginal effects”

There is no common language across fields regarding a unique meaning of
“marginal effects”. Thus, the wording throughout this package may vary.
Maybe “adjusted predictions” comes closest to what **ggeffects**
actually does. To avoid confusion about what is actually calculated and
returned by the package’s functions `ggpredict()`, `ggemmeans()` and
`ggeffect()`, it is recommended to read [this
vignette](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/introduction_marginal_effects.html)
about the different terminology and its meanings.

## Documentation and Support

## ggeffects supports many different models and is easy to use

Marginal effects and adjusted predictions can be calculated for many
different models. Currently supported model-objects are: `averaging`,
`bamlss`, `bayesx`, `betabin`, `betareg`, `bglmer`, `blmer`, `bracl`,
`brglm`, `brmsfit`, `brmultinom`, `cgam`, `cgamm`, `clm`, `clm2`,
`clmm`, `coxph`, `fixest`, `gam` (package **mgcv**), `Gam` (package
**gam**), `gamlss`, `gamm`, `gamm4`, `gee`, `geeglm`, `glm`, `glm.nb`,
`glmer`, `glmer.nb`, `glmmTMB`, `glmmPQL`, `glmrob`, `glmRob`, `glmx`,
`gls`, `hurdle`, `ivreg`, `lm`, `lm_robust`, `lme`, `lmer`, `lmrob`,
`lmRob`, `logistf`, `logitr`, `lrm`, `mclogit`, `mlogit`, `MixMod`,
`MCMCglmm`, `mixor`, `multinom`, `negbin`, `nlmer`, `ols`, `orm`, `plm`,
`polr`, `rlm`, `rlmer`, `rq`, `rqss`, `stanreg`, `survreg`, `svyglm`,
`svyglm.nb`, `tidymodels`, `tobit`, `truncreg`, `vgam`, `wbm`,
`zeroinfl` and `zerotrunc`.

Support for models varies by function, i.e. although `ggpredict()`,
`ggemmeans()` and `ggeffect()` support most models, some models are only
supported exclusively by one of the three functions. Other models not
listed here might work as well, but are currently not tested.

Interaction terms, splines and polynomial terms are also supported. The
main functions are `ggpredict()`, `ggemmeans()` and `ggeffect()`. There
is a generic `plot()`-method to plot the results using **ggplot2**.

## Examples

The returned data frames always have the same, consistent structure and
column names, so it’s easy to create ggplot-plots without the need to
re-write the function call. `x` and `predicted` are the values for the
x- and y-axis. `conf.low` and `conf.high` could be used as `ymin` and
`ymax` aesthetics for ribbons to add confidence bands to the plot.
`group` can be used as grouping-aesthetics, or for faceting.

`ggpredict()` requires at least one, but not more than four terms
specified in the `terms`-argument. Predicted values of the response,
along the values of the first term are calculated, optionally grouped by
the other terms specified in `terms`.

``` r
library(ggeffects)
library(splines)
data(efc)
fit <- lm(barthtot ~ c12hour + bs(neg_c_7) * c161sex + e42dep, data = efc)

ggpredict(fit, terms = "c12hour")
#> # Predicted values of barthtot
#> 
#> c12hour | Predicted |         95% CI
#> ------------------------------------
#>       4 |     67.89 | [65.81, 69.96]
#>      12 |     67.07 | [65.10, 69.05]
#>      22 |     66.06 | [64.19, 67.94]
#>      36 |     64.64 | [62.84, 66.45]
#>      49 |     63.32 | [61.51, 65.14]
#>      70 |     61.20 | [59.22, 63.17]
#>     100 |     58.15 | [55.71, 60.60]
#>     168 |     51.26 | [47.27, 55.25]
#> 
#> Adjusted for:
#> * neg_c_7 = 11.83
#> * c161sex =  1.76
#> *  e42dep =  2.93
```

A possible call to ggplot could look like this:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
mydf <- ggpredict(fit, terms = "c12hour")
ggplot(mydf, aes(x, predicted)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), alpha = .1)
```

![](man/figures/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

However, there is also a `plot()`-method. This method uses convenient
defaults, to easily create the most suitable plot for the marginal
effects.

``` r
mydf <- ggpredict(fit, terms = "c12hour")
plot(mydf)
```

![](man/figures/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

With three variables, predictions can be grouped and faceted.

``` r
ggpredict(fit, terms = c("neg_c_7", "c161sex", "e42dep"))
#> # Predicted values of barthtot
#> 
#> # c161sex = 1
